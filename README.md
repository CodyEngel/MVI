# MVI
Just a simple collection of resourced related to Model View Intent.

## General MVI Information

[Cycle.js Model-View-Intent](https://cycle.js.org/model-view-intent.html) is an overview of what MVI is. As far as I can tell this is where this term was first used so you can consider it the _birth place_ of Model View Intent until I'm proven wrong.

## MVI on Android

[Model-View-Intent on Android by Hannes Dorfmann](http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/model-view-intent) is possibly the first article written about the idea of MVI on Android.

[Reactive Apps With Model-View-Intent Part 1 by Hannes Dorfmann](http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/mosby3-mvi-1) is the first part in a series of posts about MVI on Android. This is a great place to get information about the architecture, though I'm unsure whether having a presenter is really necessary (or even a good idea).
